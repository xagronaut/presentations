# Abstract

Let's face it. We don't communicate well, and we document even less.

Is it possible to wield information well in an Agile software team?

Yes, it is!

With consideration, change, and commitment to doing your work differently, it is possible to have relevant and vibrant knowledge resources in an Agile environment.

Instead of being told, "You're doing it wrong," teams can move to a new model that builds on empathy and excellence.

Better on-boarding means more confident teammates, a more inclusive workflow, and a focus on continuous improvement.

No matter what methodology you use, you'll gain practical techniques to improve your team's handling of know-how and achieve better collaboration.
